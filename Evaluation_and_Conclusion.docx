Chapter 1: Problem Identification
1.1 Introduction
According to Kelly (2023), effective healthcare depends not only on good clinicians or doctors but also on the availability of readable, authentic, and readily accessible patient-held medical records. The healthcare industry has traditionally relied on paper-based systems for managing patient information. In these systems, patient registration involves manual data entry into physical forms that are stored in organized files. 
The manual nature of such systems leads to inefficiencies in the security of the records, increases the risk of errors, and creates difficulties in assessing and analyzing patient information. N. Ali (2024) highlights that the manual nature of record-keeping is inherently inefficient for accessing a patient’s medical history. Despite the challenges, paper-based record-keeping systems remain widely used in many healthcare settings. This study aims to digitize paper-based record-keeping systems in healthcare departments, examining the benefits, challenges, and user acceptance of these systems.
Furthermore, inconsistencies between paper and electronic records when both are used can lead to severe problems for patient intake and treatment. The transition to Electronic Health Records (EHRs)is therefore crucial to address these shortcomings and improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivery. During studies in 2014, N. Ali observed that paper-based record keeping poses significant security risks, unlike EHRs, which use encryption and access tracking, anyone can help themselves to paper files, creating the possibility of fraud or identity theft. This simply means that someone can pilfer the files and use the information to obtain health-care services for someone else. Paper records are also prone to fire, flood, and other natural disasters, and they do not have backups.
The CareConnect App is a cutting-edge mobile application developed to modernize and optimize healthcare management systems. Unlike traditional paper-based methods, CareConnect leverages innovative technologies such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing to deliver a comprehensive, efficient, and personalized healthcare experience.
In many healthcare facilities, the current reliance on paper records poses significant challenges. These include the risk of data loss, inefficient record-keeping, and the difficulty of extracting valuable insights from unstructured clinical notes. Such limitations hinder the ability of medical practitioners to deliver personalized treatment plans and perform effective data analysis. The CareConnect App addresses these issues by digitizing patient records and providing healthcare professionals with advanced tools for data analysis and personalized care.

1.2 Investigation and description of the current system / Literature on existing similar systems

In the current paper-based healthcare management system, patient registration involves manually entering details into physical forms, which are stored in organized files. During medical consultations, doctors take handwritten notes on patient conditions, diagnoses, and treatment plans, adding these notes to the patient's file. The patient sometimes provides information such as treatment history during consultation, which cannot be true. Medical practitioners then perform statistical analyses manually using the recorded data. Treatment and procedure details are recorded on paper, and laboratory results are physically attached to the patient's file. In other hospitals and clinics, appointments are usually scheduled using paper calendars, and data retrieval requires staff to manually search through physical files. This system is prone to inefficiencies, errors, and difficulties in accessing and analyzing patient information.







1.3 Statement of the problem

Health management is a crucial area in the world, and it is increasingly neglected by most clinics and hospitals when managing the records of their patients. Challenges of the current health management system include:
•	Inefficient Record-Keeping: Paper records can be easily lost or damaged, resulting in incomplete patient histories. Recording and retrieving patient information manually is time-consuming for administrative staff and healthcare professionals.
•	Lack of Data Analysis and Insights: Without statistical analyses and machine learning models, it becomes challenging to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in patient data. Medical practitioners miss out on the ability to predict patient outcomes and potential complications based on historical data and health indicators.
•	Inadequate Personalized Treatment: Without personalized treatment plans tailored to individual patients, care may not be optimized for each patient's unique medical history and conditions. Identifying critical health issues early can be difficult without advanced data analysis, leading to delayed interventions.
•	Difficulty in Extracting Insights from Clinical Notes: Clinical notes are often unstructured and full of valuable information. Important details and insights from clinical notes may go unnoticed, impacting patient care and outcomes.
